# Glucose & Lifestyle – Personal Health Data Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between blood glucose levels and various lifestyle factors such as exercise, insulin intake, meal composition, stress, and daily routines. The data used is real and personally collected throughout the year 2024, with the goal of identifying behavioral patterns and improving health outcomes through data analysis.

## Objectives
- Track glucose fluctuations over time.
- Understand the impact of exercise intensity and frequency.
- Analyze effects of insulin usage and timing.
- Evaluate stress-related events on glycemic control.
- Build visual dashboards to support decision-making and medical conversations.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- BigQuery (SQL transformations)
- Tableau (Dashboard creation)

## Key Findings
- Increased exercise frequency correlated with reduced average glucose levels.
- High-stress periods (illness or exams) showed noticeable glycemic spikes.
- Adjusting insulin dosage without lifestyle change often led to hypoglycemia.
- Seasonal patterns in behavior influenced glycemic stability.

## Folder Contents
- `/data`: Cleaned and synthetic glucose dataset.
- `/notebooks`: Python scripts for preprocessing and analysis.
